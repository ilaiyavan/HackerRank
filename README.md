=============

The computing cluster has multiple processors, each with 4 cores. The number of tasks to handle is equal to the total number of cores in the cluster. Each task has a predicted execution time and each processor has a specified time when its core becomes available. Assuming that exactly 4 tasks are assigned to each processor and those tasks run independently(asynchronously) on the cores of the chosen processor, what is the earliest time that all tasks can be processed.

Input:
=====
processortTime = [8,10]
taskTime = [2,2,3,1,8,7,4,5]

Output:
======
16
